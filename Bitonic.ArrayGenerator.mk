## Pseudocode: Generate Unimodal Array with Random Peak Position

1. If n <= 0, return an empty list.
2. If n == 1, return a list with a single element (increment).
3. Randomly select a peak position between 0 and n-1.
4. Initialize an array of size n with all zeros.
5. Set the peak value at the chosen position: peak_value = increment * peak_position.
6. Assign peak_value to the array at peak_position.
7. For indices to the left of the peak (from peak_position-1 down to 0):
    - Set arr[i] = arr[i+1] - increment
8. For indices to the right of the peak (from peak_position+1 up to n-1):
    - Set arr[i] = arr[i-1] - increment
9. Return the Array.
